# Guideline

For writing the Begin With It pages, we will be using Markdown syntax. Following materials will be useful if you are not familiar with Markdown syntax.
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Followings are the guidelines of writing the pages which should be located in [/content](https://github.com/asankasri/begin-with-it-alpha/tree/master/content) directorly.

After create a new page, please do not forget to add it in the main [README.md](https://github.com/asankasri/begin-with-it-alpha/blob/master/README.md) file.

## File Name
* Name of the file should be lowercase and seperated with hyphen for multiple words
* Files should be in .md format
* Ex:
  * angular.md
  * react-native.md

## Structure
* Icon
* Title
* Official Links
* Content

### >>> Icon
* Icons should be located in [/icons](https://github.com/asankasri/begin-with-it-alpha/tree/master/icons) directorly
* Icon names should follow the file names
* Icon format is .png and the size is 128x128
* So that the full name of the should be, {filename}_128x128.png
* Ex:
  * angular_128x128.png
  * react-native_128x128.png

### >>> Title
* Title should follow the title case.
* Format of the title is, "Begin with {Technology Name}"
* Icon also will stay together with the title.
* Ex:
```
# ![Angular](https://rawgit.com/asankasri/begin-with-it-alpha/master/icons/angular_128x128.png "Angular") Begin with Angular
```
```
# ![React Native](https://rawgit.com/asankasri/begin-with-it-alpha/master/icons/react-native_128x128.png "React Native") Begin with React Native
```
* Note: RawGit is used to fetch the icon.
